a service allows to build visual workflows for business processes
- orchestrate data flow in an automated environment, e.g. check if username and email provided are valid. if so, aloow users to open a new account.
- based on state machine (==workflow) and tasks

benefits:
- build and deploy fast
- write less integration code
- reliable and scalable

state typesL
- pass: push input to output
- task: takes input and produces output
- choice: allows the user to use branching logic based on the input
- wait: it adds delays to state machine execution
- success: has and expected finish-line: dead-end that stops execution successfully
- fail: has an expected dead-end-stops execution with a failure
- parallel: implements parallel branches in execution -- use can start multiple states at once
- mapping:(dynamic) runs a set of steps for every input item


set wait time as an input variable
(1) remove prior block's result otherwise it will pass this value
(2) "secondpath" : "$.waittime
(3) at input json box: {"waittime":"10"} # set up wait time to 10 seconds

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
task can be a lambda function
